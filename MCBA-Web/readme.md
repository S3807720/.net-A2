Records have been utilized for transactions, as these should not be ever changed, and refunds and such would 
be new transactions. This also allows the ability to duplicate the 
original transaction and adjust the destination and account number associated with the 'with' command
to allow easier creation of service charges and receiving transfer payments.

BillPays will be automatically attempted on startup and every 5 minutes unless cancelled or the payment is
finished after a one-time payment. These can be cancelled, editted(if not finished or blocked) or paid if 
the payment failed. The failed payments will be highlighted on the billpay page until paid or cancelled.
Cancelled and finished payments will still show up here, but cannot be changed.

Identity was attempted in one of the Git branches, but abandoned due to the amount of work involved.

**NOTE** Click on the privacy page at the bottom of the CUSTOMER page
 to generate 100s of random transactions for appropriate data.

Charts have been added, one showing the transactions for the account by month on the accounts page. This utilizes all
transactions for the accounts for the customer logged in. It also displays the types in a pie chart below it.

These charts have also been added to show all accounts in the admin home page.
