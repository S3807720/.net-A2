Records have been utilized for transactions, as these should not be ever changed, and refunds and such would 
be new transactions. This also allows the ability to duplicate the 
original transaction and adjust the destination and account number associated with the 'with' command
to allow easier creation of service charges and receiving transfer payments.

Identity was attempted in one of the Git branches, but abandoned due to the amount of work involved.

**NOTE** Click on the privacy page to generate 100s of random transactions for appropriate data.

Charts have been added, one showing the transactions for the account by month on the home page. This utilizes all
transactions for the accounts under the customer logged in. It also displays the types in a pie chart below it.

These charts have also been added to show all accounts in the admin home page.
