Withdraw/depo/transfer -> confirm -> update mcbacontext /

Statement -> view balance of specific account and pages of 4 transactions ordered by recent. /

My profile -> show details and allow editing name, tfn, addr, suburb, state, postcode, mobile /

Add record type variables somehow. probably in transactions as these can't be removed.

BillPay -> show all current billpays, modify or cancel these. 
Once a bill is scheduled these should be automatically executed at the date and time scheduled
by the user. The bill payment should fail if the account has an insufficient balance. If failure
occurs the error should be conveyed to the user on the BillPay page with options to deal with
the error, for example cancel, reschedule, or try again, etcâ€¦

HD stuff in doc... just login and admin stuff

This place is a good choice, as well as being able to duplicate the original transaction and adjust the 
destination and account number associated with the 'with' command.
